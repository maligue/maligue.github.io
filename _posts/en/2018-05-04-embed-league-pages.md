Want to manage your league without hassle with Maligue but you also want to keep your own website? No problem! You can integrate the calendar, ranking and statistics into your own pages.

You must first activate the website in your league settings. Then, enable the calendar page, ranking, or statistics so that the HTML elements are available. Copy the HTML code into your website at the desired location. Items are displayed using the iframe HTML element.

If you have any questions or comments please contact us at [info@maligue.ca](mailto:info@maligue.ca).
